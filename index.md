# Welcome

It's Max, I am glad you found my website. I am a researcher at Stanford's [SUNCAT](http://suncat.slac.stanford.edu/) Institute for Sustainable eNergy through CATalysis. I develop methods and tools to build better models for predicting the activity and selectivity of heterogeneous catalysts on an atomistic level. 

In my research I aim for a better fundamental understanding of the intricate interplay between morphology, co-adsorbate interactions, adlayer formation, and reaction conditions of catalytic processes. Currently, I try to better understand adsorbate-adorbate interaction between arbitrary small molecules on transition and coinage metal surfaces on an electronic structure level of description.

Please feel free to have a look around and help yourself if you find anything useful.
