# How lenting and meditation has helped my through my PhD

Today I would like to today about why I picked up the practice of lenting alcohol two years ago and I intend
to stick and I have not intention of ever dropping this.

Maybe you found this text because you are thinking about doing something similar, maybe you are just curious
about what it is and how it works. I want to share my perspective because I have discovered lenting almost
by accident and I am really surprised by the positive impact it is has had on my live. 

So first, who do I lent? Well, I don't lent for religous reasons. Many people lent for religous reasons
and I think there is something to the fact that many religions (i.e. people in different part of the
world) have discovered the practice of giving something up. But I think that lenting alcohol can be
really good for just about anyone who wants to make a difference in his life.

## How did it start

Here goes the story: two years ago I was in the middle of researching and writing for my PhD thesis. Actually
the this does not matter at all, but rather the fact that one was in the middle of a 3-5 year project
with a stretchable, yet, rigorous deadline. I guess I do not have to explain to other former or current
PhD students that this can be sometimes stressful. Actually this can be quite stressful. Being confronted
with longer deadlines and wondering how much progress one has made towards it and how much is left to
do can be quite stressful.

Around the middle of that time a friend told me about the practice of meditation. And while there are many
different forms of meditation and I had heard many times about it before, somehow this time it hit me
like a huge discovery. My friend told me about how meditation has helped to control his thoughts. 
That alone may not sound like a lot but when you reflect how most thought happen inside your head one realizes
that is is really huge. I realized that often I find myself in the middle of chains of thought that I
have no idea where they can come from I and I have only at best minimal influence about where they go to.
And that I downright scary because after all this inside my own head. I mean if I don't control over that little
part of the world, is there any control left?

I may not have noticed this before but I guess my PhD research has amplified this habit of having long thought
chains that gave me the feeling of being constantly on. So me friends simple remark made me sit down and
meditate. In that moment I felt and almost instant relieve. And I invite everyone in a stressful part of
his life to try the same. Basically meditation to me that in small time pockets of the day you don't have
to do anything, don't have to solve any problems, don't have to come with any smart ideas. You have only
job and that is to concentrate on your breath and think nothing. They amazing thing about it is that you need
no fancy equipment and no special theory. You just sit down and meditate for yourself.

## Different thinking moods

Having done so for a couple of weeks I realized that I attained quite a new level of soberness. It is hard
to describe it when you haven't tried it yourself. But it is very clear once you have meditated for a certain
while. Maybe soberness is not quite the right word, but it describes quite clearly my feeling. Basically,
when you are drunk you have very little control over your thought. Your mind is constantly drifting and
it is drifting quite fast. There are many impulses that enter your mind and you often given in quite quickly.
Often this is an intended side effect as if you have a little voice saying in your head: go dance with that
girl. And you don't think twice about that could happen if you ask her out. You just go ahead and do it.

On the other end of the spectrum there is a very sober mode of thinking. A mode where you can think about
long term goals, about what you really want in life and what kind of things are good for you. Where
you can cleary tell right from wrong based on your own set of principles and act accordingly. I noticed
that I have this mode of thinking when I talk to people who are really important to me such as parents,
mentors, and teachers. I made the fundamental realization that almost all important conversations I ever had in
my life with people I profoundly care about I was totally sober. And that basically whenver I talk to a
person I deeply care about I rather want to be 100% sober.

So that is it, there is one kind of deep long term thinking and then there is another flat and short term
thinking. And those those to do not mix well. Once I have realized this I noticed that meditating does
something to your head which is about having stable and reliable thought with a long term plan. And
drinking alcohol produces the exact opposite to that.

Once I realized that I wanted to explore being sober more deeply. And along came the time between Carneval
and Easter. So I thought why not give up alcohol for those 40 days. After all this seems to be a well
tested time span. It is long enough that you definitely feel the difference.

One of the first things I noticed is that as a party conversation people pay a lot more attention than
most other things you can talk about on parties. Consider the following two narratives: "I got so
shit faced last night, I can't even remember how I got to wake up where I woke up" with "So, I stopped
drinking for 40 days and meditation is a really powerful practice." Where will people tend to ask more
questions about the why and how? You guess it. They want to know everything about it. And that so
interesting. Because basically what you doing is *not doing* something, like drinking alcohol and
having uncontrolled thought. And all of a suddend that is interesting? Whoa, what a profound discovery!

So there you have: meditation and lenting gave me back a level of control over my head that has gone missing
in the time before. And that is so powerful. I think this can actually help in  almost every life situation
but during a PhD thesis there is probably a more long term effect to this: it makes the difference between
either not having a PhD or having a PhD and being happy with it because you also regained so much more
control over your life.

Please try it out and feel free to share your experiences.
