# Batteries or Hydrocarbons as Solar Fuels

The limited sustainabilty of using fossil fuels is today really obvious for two reasons:
humanity is using fossil fuels at a rate that is faster than new ones are being produced
and once the fossil fuels reserved currently stored on earth the chemical compositions
of the earth's atmosphere is significantly changed.

Research questions:

    - how different is the earth atmosphere one all fossil fuels are used
    - what is the better intermediate storage device: ion storage or chemical conversion

Batteries are one technology of energy storage: the basic principle is: why take the
lightest possible ions (e.g. Li) and by using and electric field we drive them into
a state of higher potential energy. Etc. fill out on most desirable properties ...

Hydrocarbons are another technology. The name of the game here is to reduce the
number of carbon to oxygen bonds and maximize the number of carbon to hydrogen bonds.

In this sense hydrocarbons can be viewed as a battery as if one used an electrical driving
force to reduce the number of carbon-oxygen bonds and replace them by carbon-hydrogen bonds



## Bottom-Up
### Batteries

Pros:

- very efficient charge/discharge process

Cons:

- slow charging time
- low energy density per weight unit
- potentially limited by availability of storage medium, e.g. Li


### Liquid hydrocarbons

Pros:

- high energy efficiency per weight unit
- easy to store/transport/handle
- good integration with existing (combustion) technology

Cons:

- currently high loss in charge process
- discharge 


## Top-Down

- how can cargo ships and air planes run on batteries?
- is there really enough Li for the possible global demand of batteries?
- What is the break-even point for overpotential?
